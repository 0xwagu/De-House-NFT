# Core Feature: Fractionalization

- Each asset is represented as a “series” with a fixed supply of fractional units (ERC-1155).
- Units can be minted during primary sale and optionally enabled for secondary transfers under compliance controls.
- Governance per series may define redemptions, buybacks, and fees.

Lifecycle:
1) Origination and series creation
2) Primary offering (minting)
3) Secondary market transfer (optional)
4) Distributions (proceeds, yield)
5) Redemption / wind-down
