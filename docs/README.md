# Documentation Portal

Welcome to the unified documentation for two related initiatives:
- RWA Fractional Co-Ownership Protocol
- De House (Web3 organization)

Use the sidebar to navigate each domain. The Protocol covers technical architecture, smart contracts, user flows, and implementation guidelines. De House covers governance, treasury strategy, fundraising, legal, and community operations.

If you’re integrating smart contracts, start with “Protocol → Technical Specifications”.
If you’re evaluating organizational operations, start with “De House → Overview”.
